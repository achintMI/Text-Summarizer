      "mr. and mrs. dursley, of number four, privet drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. they were the last people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn't hold with such nonsense. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "mr. dursley was the director of a firm called grunnings, which made drills. he was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large mustache. mrs. dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors. the dursleys had a small son called dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "the dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. they didn't think they could bear it if anyone found out about the potters. mrs. potter was mrs. dursley's sister, but they hadn't met for several years; in fact, mrs. dursley pretended she didn't have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as undursleyish as it was possible to be. the dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the potters arrived in the street. the dursleys knew that the potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him. this boy was another good reason for keeping the potters away; they didn't want dudley mixing with a child like that. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "when mr. and mrs. dursley woke up on the dull, gray tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country. mr. dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work, and mrs. dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming dudley into his high chair. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "none of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "at half past eight, mr. dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked mrs. dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss dudley good-bye but missed, because dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls. \"little tyke,\" chortled mr. dursley as he left the house. he got into his car and backed out of number four's drive. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "it was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar -- a cat reading a map. for a second, mr. dursley didn't realize what he had seen -- then he jerked his head around to look again. there was a tabby cat standing on the corner of privet drive, but there wasn't a map in sight. what could he have been thinking of? it must have been a trick of the light. mr. dursley blinked and stared at the cat. it stared back. as mr. dursley drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. it was now reading the sign that said privet drive -- no, looking at the sign; cats couldn't read maps or signs. mr. dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind. as he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "but on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something else. as he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn't help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about. people in cloaks. mr. dursley couldn't bear people who dressed in funny clothes -- the getups you saw on young people! he supposed this was some stupid new fashion. he drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by. they were whispering excitedly together. mr. dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren't young at all; why, that man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! the nerve of him! but then it struck mr. dursley that this was probably some silly stunt -- these people were obviously collecting for something... \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "yes, that would be it. the traffic moved on and a few minutes later, mr. dursley arrived in the grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "mr. dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor. if he hadn't, he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning. he didn't see the owls swoop ing past in broad daylight, though people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed open- mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead. most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime. mr. dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl-free morning. he yelled at five different people. he made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more. he was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he'd stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "he'd forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker's. he eyed them angrily as he passed. he didn't know why, but they made him uneasy. this bunch were whispering excitedly, too, and he couldn't see a single collecting tin. it was on his way back past them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words of what they were saying. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"the potters, that's right, that's what i heard yes, their son, harry\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "mr. dursley stopped dead. fear flooded him. he looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better of it. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "he dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind. he put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache, thinking... no, he was being stupid. potter wasn't such an unusual name. he was sure there were lots of people called potter who had a son called harry. come to think of it, he wasn't even sure his nephew was called harry. he'd never even seen the boy. it might have been harvey. or harold. there was no point in worrying mrs. dursley; she always got so upset at any mention of her sister. he didn't blame her -- if he'd had a sister like that... but all the same, those people in cloaks... \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "he found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five o'clock, he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"sorry,\" he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. it was a few seconds before mr. dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak. he didn't seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground. on the contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare, \"don't be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today! rejoice, for you-know-who has gone at last! even muggles like yourself should be celebrating, this happy, happy day!\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "and the old man hugged mr. dursley around the middle and walked off. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "mr. dursley stood rooted to the spot. he had been hugged by a complete stranger. he also thought he had been called a muggle, whatever that was. he was rattled. he hurried to his car and set off for home, hoping he was imagining things, which he had never hoped before, because he didn't approve of imagination. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "as he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he saw -- and it didn't improve his mood -- was the tabby cat he'd spotted that morning. it was now sitting on his garden wall. he was sure it was the same one; it had the same markings around its eyes. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"shoo!\" said mr. dursley loudly. the cat didn't move. it just gave him a stern look. was this normal cat behavior? mr. dursley wondered. trying to pull himself together, he let himself into the house. he was still determined not to mention anything to his wife. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "mrs. dursley had had a nice, normal day. she told him over dinner all about mrs. next door's problems with her daughter and how dudley had learned a new word (\"won't!\"). mr. dursley tried to act normally. when dudley had been put to bed, he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news: \"and finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nation's owls have been behaving very unusually today. although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise. experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern.\" the newscaster allowed himself a grin. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"most mysterious. and now, over to jim mcguffin with the weather. going to be any more showers of owls tonight, jim?\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"well, ted,\" said the weatherman, \"i don't know about that, but it's not only the owls that have been acting oddly today. viewers as far apart as kent, yorkshire, and dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain i promised yesterday, they've had a downpour of shooting stars! perhaps people have been celebrating bonfire night early -- it's not until next week, folks! but i can promise a wet night tonight.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "mr. dursley sat frozen in his armchair. shooting stars all over britain? owls flying by daylight? mysterious people in cloaks all over the place? and a whisper, a whisper about the potters... \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "mrs. dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea. it was no good. he'd have to say something to her. he cleared his throat nervously. \"er -- petunia, dear -- you haven't heard from your sister lately, have you?\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "as he had expected, mrs. dursley looked shocked and angry. after all, they normally pretended she didn't have a sister. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"no,\" she said sharply. \"why?\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"funny stuff on the news,\" mr. dursley mumbled. \"owls... shooting stars... and there were a lot of funny-looking people in town today...\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"so?\" snapped mrs. dursley. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"well, i just thought... maybe... it was something to do with... you know... her crowd.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "mrs. dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. mr. dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he'd heard the name \"potter.\" he decided he didn't dare. instead he said, as casually as he could, \"their son -- he'd be about dudley's age now, wouldn't he?\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"i suppose so,\" said mrs. dursley stiffly. \r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "while mrs. dursley was in the bathroom, mr. dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden. the cat was still there. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "it was staring down privet drive as though it were waiting for something. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "was he imagining things? could all this have anything to do with the potters? if it did... if it got out that they were related to a pair of -- well, he didn't think he could bear it. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "the dursleys got into bed. mrs. dursley fell asleep quickly but mr. dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. his last, comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the potters were involved, there was no reason for them to come near him and mrs. dursley. the potters knew very well what he and petunia thought about them and their kind.... he couldn't see how he and petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on -- he yawned and turned over -- it couldn't affect them.... \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "how very wrong he was. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "mr. dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. it was sitting as still as a statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of privet drive. it didn't so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two owls swooped overhead. in fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "a man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so suddenly and silently you'd have thought he'd just popped out of the ground. the cat's tail twitched and its eyes narrowed. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "nothing like this man had ever been seen on privet drive. he was tall, thin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt. he was wearing long robes, a purple cloak that swept the ground, and high-heeled, buckled boots. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "his blue eyes were light, bright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice. this man's name was albus dumbledore. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "albus dumbledore didn't seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome. he was busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. but he did seem to realize he was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still staring at him from the other end of the street. for some reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him. he chuckled and muttered, \"i should have known.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "he found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. it seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter. he flicked it open, held it up in the air, and clicked it. the nearest street lamp went out with a little pop. he clicked it again -- the next lamp flickered into darkness. twelve times he clicked the put-outer, until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat watching him. if anyone looked out of their window now, even beady-eyed mrs. dursley, they wouldn't be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement. dumbledore slipped the put-outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four, where he sat down on the wall next to the cat. he didn't look at it, but after a moment he spoke to it. \r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "he turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. instead he was smiling at a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes. she, too, was wearing a cloak, an emerald one. her black hair was drawn into a tight bun. she looked distinctly ruffled. \r\n",

      "\"you'd think they'd be a bit more careful, but no -- even the muggles have noticed something's going on. it was on their news.\" she jerked her head back at the dursleys' dark living-room window. \"i heard it. flocks of owls... shooting stars.... well, they're not completely stupid. they were bound to notice something. shooting stars down in kent -- i'll bet that was dedalus diggle. he never had much sense.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"you can't blame them,\" said dumbledore gently. \"we've had precious little to celebrate for eleven years.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"i know that,\" said professor mcgonagall irritably. \"but that's no reason to lose our heads. people are being downright careless, out on the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in muggle clothes, swapping rumors.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "she threw a sharp, sideways glance at dumbledore here, as though hoping he was going to tell her something, but he didn't, so she went on. \"a fine thing it would be if, on the very day youknow-who seems to have disappeared at last, the muggles found out about us all. i suppose he really has gone, dumbledore?\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"it certainly seems so,\" said dumbledore. \"we have much to be thankful for. would you care for a lemon drop?\" \r\n",

      "\"my dear professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name? all this 'you- know-who' nonsense -- for eleven years i have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name: voldemort.\" professor mcgonagall flinched, but dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to notice. \"it all gets so confusing if we keep saying 'you-know-who.' i have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying voldemort's name. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"i know you haven 't, said professor mcgonagall, sounding half exasperated, half admiring. \"but you're different. everyone knows you're the only one you-know- oh, all right, voldemort, was frightened of.\" \r\n",

      "\"you flatter me,\" said dumbledore calmly. \"voldemort had powers i will never have.\" \r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "it seemed that professor mcgonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss, the real reason she had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now. it was plain that whatever \"everyone\" was saying, she was not going to believe it until dumbledore told her it was true. dumbledore, however, was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer. \r\n",

      "on the other hand, he'd gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchens. dudley's gang had been chasing him as usual when, as much to harry's surprise as anyone else's, there he was sitting on the chimney. the dursleys had received a very angry letter from harry's headmistress telling them harry had been climbing school buildings. but all he'd tried to do (as he shouted at uncle vernon through the locked door of his cupboard) was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors. harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in mid- jump. \r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "harry picked it up and stared at it, his heart twanging like a giant elastic band. no one, ever, in his whole life, had written to him. who would? he had no friends, no other relatives -- he didn't belong to the library, so he'd never even got rude notes asking for books back. yet here it was, a letter, addressed so plainly there could be no mistake: mr. h. potter the cupboard under the stairs 4 privet drive little whinging surrey the envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish parchment, and the address was written in emerald-green ink. there was no stamp. \r\n",

      "he had a swarthy, clever face, a pointed beard and, harry noticed, very long fingers and feet. he bowed as they walked inside. now they were facing a second pair of doors, silver this time, with words engraved upon them: enter, stranger, but take heed of what awaits the sin of greed, for those who take, but do not earn, must pay most dearly in their turn. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "so if you seek beneath our floors a treasure that was never yours, thief, you have been warned, beware of finding more than treasure there. \r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "a pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they were in a vast marble hall. about a hundred more goblins were sitting on high stools behind a long counter, scribbling in large ledgers, weighing coins in brass scales, examining precious stones through eyeglasses. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "there were too many doors to count leading off the hall, and yet more goblins were showing people in and out of these. hagrid and harry made for the counter. \r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"you have his key, sir?\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"got it here somewhere,\" said hagrid, and he started emptying his pockets onto the counter, scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits over the goblin's book of numbers. the goblin wrinkled his nose. harry watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as glowing coals. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"got it,\" said hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden key. \r\n",

      "\"that seems to be in order.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"an' i've also got a letter here from professor dumbledore,\" said hagrid importantly, throwing out his chest. \"it's about the youknow-what in vault seven hundred and thirteen.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "the goblin read the letter carefully. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"very well,\" he said, handing it back to hagrid, \"i will have someone take you down to both vaults. griphook!\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "griphook was yet another goblin. once hagrid had crammed all the dog biscuits back inside his pockets, he and harry followed griphook toward one of the doors leading off the hall. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"what's the you-know-what in vault seven hundred and thirteen?\" harry asked. \r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "griphook held the door open for them. harry, who had expected more marble, was surprised. they were in a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming torches. it sloped steeply downward and there were little railway tracks on the floor. griphook whistled and a small cart came hurtling up the tracks toward them. they climbed in -- hagrid with some difficulty -- and were off. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "at first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages. harry tried to remember, left, right, right, left, middle fork, right, left, but it was impossible. the rattling cart seemed to know its own way, because griphook wasn't steering. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "harry's eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, but he kept them wide open. once, he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon, but too late - - they plunged even deeper, passing an underground lake where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floor. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "i never know,\" harry called to hagrid over the noise of the cart, \"what's the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite?\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"stalagmite's got an 'm' in it,\" said hagrid. \"an' don' ask me questions just now, i think i'm gonna be sick.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "he did look very green, and when the cart stopped at last beside a small door in the passage wall, hagrid got out and had to lean against the wall to stop his knees from trembling. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "griphook unlocked the door. a lot of green smoke came billowing out, and as it cleared, harry gasped. inside were mounds of gold coins. columns of silver. heaps of little bronze knuts. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"all yours,\" smiled hagrid. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "all harry's -- it was incredible. the dursleys couldn't have known about this or they'd have had it from him faster than blinking. how often had they complained how much harry cost them to keep? and all the time there had been a small fortune belonging to him, buried deep under london. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "hagrid helped harry pile some of it into a bag. \r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"one speed only,\" said griphook. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "they were going even deeper now and gathering speed. the air became colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners. they went rattling over an underground ravine, and harry leaned over the side to try to see what was down at the dark bottom, but hagrid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff of his neck. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole. \r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "something really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault, harry was sure, and he leaned forward eagerly, expecting to see fabulous jewels at the very least -- but at first he thought it was empty. then he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor. hagrid picked it up and tucked it deep inside his coat. harry longed to know what it was, but knew better than to ask. \r\n",

      "\"no more'n four to a boat!\" hagrid called, pointing to a fleet of little boats sitting in the water by the shore. harry and ron were followed into their boat by neville and hermione. \"everyone in?\" shouted hagrid, who had a boat to himself. \"right then -- forward!\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "and the fleet of little boats moved off all at once, gliding across the lake, which was as smooth as glass. everyone was silent, staring up at the great castle overhead. it towered over them as they sailed nearer and nearer to the cliff on which it stood. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"heads down!\" yelled hagrid as the first boats reached the cliff; they all bent their heads and the little boats carried them through a curtain of ivy that hid a wide opening in the cliff face. they were carried along a dark tunnel, which seemed to be taking them right underneath the castle, until they reached a kind of underground harbor, where they clambered out onto rocks and pebbles. \r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"oh, we're not working,\" harry told him brightly. \"ever since you mentioned nicolas flamel we've been trying to find out who he is.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "they had indeed been searching books for flamel's name ever since hagrid had let it slip, because how else were they going to find out what snape was trying to steal? the trouble was, it was very hard to know where to begin, not knowing what flamel might have done to get himself into a book. he wasn't in great wizards of the twentieth century, or notable magical names of our time; he was missing, too, from important modern magical discoveries, and a study of recent developments in wizardry. and then, of course, there was the sheer size of the library; tens of thousands of books; thousands of shelves; hundreds of narrow rows. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "hermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had decided to search while ron strode off down a row of books and started pulling them off the shelves at random. harry wandered over to the restricted section. he had been wondering for a while if flamel wasn't somewhere in there. unfortunately, you needed a specially signed note from one of the teachers to look in any of the restricted books, and he knew he'd never get one. these were the books containing powerful dark magic never taught at hogwarts, and only read by older students studying advanced defense against the dark arts. \r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "wishing he'd been a bit quicker at thinking up some story, harry left the library. he, ron, and hermione had already agreed they'd better not ask madam pince where they could find flamel. they were sure she'd be able to tell them, but they couldn't risk snape hearing what they were up to. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "harry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had found anything, but he wasn't very hopeful. they had been looking for two weeks, after a, but as they only had odd moments between lessons it wasn't surprising they'd found nothing. what they really needed was a nice long search without madam pince breathing down their necks. \r\n",

      "once the holidays had started, ron and harry were having too good a time to think much about flamel. they had the dormitory to themselves and the common room was far emptier than usual, so they were able to get the good armchairs by the fire. they sat by the hour eating anything they could spear on a toasting fork -- bread, english muffins, marshmallows -- and plotting ways of getting malfoy expelled, which were fun to talk about even if they wouldn't work. \r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "one book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood. the hairs on the back of harry's neck prickled. maybe he was imagining it, maybe not, but he thought a faint whispering was coming from the books, as though they knew someone was there who shouldn't be. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "he had to start somewhere. setting the lamp down carefully on the floor, he looked along the bottom shelf for an interestinglooking book. a large black and silver volume caught his eye. he pulled it out with difficulty, because it was very heavy, and, balancing it on his knee, let it fall open. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "a piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split the silence -- the book was screaming! harry snapped it shut, but the shriek went on and on, one high, unbroken, earsplitting note. he stumbled backward and knocked over his lamp, which went out at once. panicking, he heard footsteps coming down the corridor outside -- stuffing the shrieking book back on the shelf, he ran for it. he passed filch in the doorway; filch's pale, wild eyes looked straight through him, and harry slipped under filch's outstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor, the book's shrieks still ringing in his ears. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "he came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor. he had been so busy getting away from the library, he hadn't paid attention to where he was going. perhaps because it was dark, he didn't recognize where he was at all. there was a suit of armor near the kitchens, he knew, but he must be five floors above there. \r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "harry stood rooted to the spot as filch and snape came around the corner ahead. they couldn't see him, of course, but it was a narrow corridor and if they came much nearer they'd knock right into him -- the cloak didn't stop him from being solid. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "he backed away as quietly as he could. a door stood ajar to his left. it was his only hope. he squeezed through it, holding his breath, trying not to move it, and to his relief he managed to get inside the room without their noticing anything. they walked straight past, and harry leaned against the wall, breathing deeply, listening to their footsteps dying away. that had been close, very close. it was a few seconds before he noticed anything about the room he had hidden in. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "it looked like an unused classroom. the dark shapes of desks and chairs were piled against the walls, and there was an upturned wastepaper basket -- but propped against the wall facing him was something that didn't look as if it belonged there, something that looked as if someone had just put it there to keep it out of the way. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "it was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed feet. there was an inscription carved around the top: erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi. his panic fading now that there was no sound of filch and snape, harry moved nearer to the mirror, wanting to look at himself but see no reflection again. he stepped in front of it. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "he had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming. he whirled around. his heart was pounding far more furiously than when the book had screamed -- for he had seen not only himself in the mirror, but a whole crowd of people standing right behind him. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "but the room was empty. breathing very fast, he turned slowly back to the mirror. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "there he was, reflected in it, white and scared-looking, and there, reflected behind him, were at least ten others. harry looked over his shoulder -- but still, no one was there. or were they all invisible, too? was he in fact in a room full of invisible people and this mirror's trick was that it reflected them, invisible or not? he looked in the mirror again. a woman standing right behind his reflection was smiling at him and waving. he reached out a hand and felt the air behind him. if she was really there, he'd touch her, their reflections were so close together, but he felt only air -- she and the others existed only in the mirror. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "she was a very pretty woman. she had dark red hair and her eyes -- her eyes are just like mine, harry thought, edging a little closer to the glass. bright green -- exactly the same shape, but then he noticed that she was crying; smiling, but crying at the same time. the tall, thin, black-haired man standing next to her put his arm around her. he wore glasses, and his hair was very untidy. it stuck up at the back, just as harry's did. \r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "they just looked at him, smiling. and slowly, harry looked into the faces of the other people in the mirror, and saw other pairs of green eyes like his, other noses like his, even a little old man who looked as though he had harry's knobbly knees -- harry was looking at his family, for the first time in his life. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "the potters smiled and waved at harry and he stared hungrily back at them, his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping to fall right through it and reach them. he had a powerful kind of ache inside him, half joy, half terrible sadness. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "how long he stood there, he didn't know. the reflections did not fade and he looked and looked until a distant noise brought him back to his senses. he couldn't stay here, he had to find his way back to bed. he tore his eyes away from his mother's face, whispered, \"i'll come back,\" \r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "harry couldn't eat. he had seen his parents and would be seeing them again tonight. he had almost forgotten about flamel. it didn't seem very important anymore. who cared what the three headed dog was guarding? what did it matter if snape stole it, really? \"are you all right?\" said ron. \"you look odd.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "what harry feared most was that he might not be able to find the mirror room again. with ron covered in the cloak, too, they had to walk much more slowly the next night. they tried retracing harry's route from the library, wandering around the dark passageways for nearly an hour. \r\n",

      "\"aaaaaaaaaargh!\" \r\n",

      "the pain in harry's head was so bad he fell to his knees. it took a minute or two to pass. when he looked up, the figure had gone. a centaur was standing over him, not ronan or bane; this one looked younger; he had white-blond hair and a palomino body. \r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"that is because it is a monstrous thing, to slay a unicorn,\" said firenze. \"only one who has nothing to lose, and everything to gain, would commit such a crime. the blood of a unicorn will keep you alive, even if you are an inch from death, but at a terrible price. you have slain something pure and defenseless to save yourself, and you will have but a half-life, a cursed life, from the moment the blood touches your lips.\" \r\n",

      "not for nothing, though, was harry the youngest seeker in a century. he had a knack for spotting things other people didn't. after a minute's weaving about through the whirl of rainbow feathers, he noticed a large silver key that had a bent wing, as if it had already been caught and stuffed roughly into the keyhole. \r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "ron dived, hermione rocketed upward, the key dodged them both, and harry streaked after it; it sped toward the wall, harry leaned forward and with a nasty, crunching noise, pinned it against the stone with one hand. ron and hermione's cheers echoed around the high chamber. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "they landed quickly, and harry ran to the door, the key struggling in his hand. he rammed it into the lock and turned -- it worked. the moment the lock had clicked open, the key took flight again, looking very battered now that it had been caught twice. \r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "when harry walked in there was a sudden hush, and then everybody started talking loudly at once. he slipped into a seat between ron and hermione at the gryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that people were standing up to look at him. \r\n",

      "hermione buried her face in her arms; harry strongly suspected she had burst into tears. gryffindors up and down the table were beside themselves -- they were a hundred points up. \"third -- to mr. harry potter...\" said dumbledore. the room went deadly quiet for pure nerve and outstanding courage, i award gryffindor house sixty points.\" \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "the din was deafening. those who could add up while yelling themselves hoarse knew that gryffindor now had four hundred and seventy-two points -- exactly the same as slytherin. they had tied for the house cup -- if only dumbledore had given harry just one more point. \r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "someone standing outside the great hall might well have thought some sort of explosion had taken place, so loud was the noise that erupted from the gryffindor table. harry, ron, and hermione stood up to yell and cheer as neville, white with shock, disappeared under a pile of people hugging him. he had never won so much as a point for gryffindor before. \r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "he clapped his hands. in an instant, the green hangings became scarlet and the silver became gold; the huge slytherin serpent vanished and a towering gryffindor lion took its place. snape was shaking professor mcgonagall's hand, with a horrible, forced smile. he caught harry's eye and harry knew at once that snape's feelings toward him hadn't changed one jot. this didn't worry harry. it seemed as though life would be back to normal next year, or as normal as it ever was at hogwarts. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "it was the best evening of harry's life, better than winning at quidditch, or christmas, or knocking out mountain trolls... he would never, ever forget tonight. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "harry had almost forgotten that the exam results were still to come, but come they did. to their great surprise, both he and ron passed with good marks; hermione, of course, had the best grades of the first years. even neville scraped through, his good herbology mark making up for his abysmal potions one. they had hoped that goyle, who was almost as stupid as he was mean, might be thrown out, but he had passed, too. it was a shame, but as ron said, you couldn't have everything in life. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "and suddenly, their wardrobes were empty, their trunks were packed, neville's toad was found lurking in a corner of the toilets; notes were handed out to all students, warning them not to use magic over the holidays (\"i always hope they'll forget to give us these,\" said fred weasley sadly); hagrid was there to take them down to the fleet of boats that sailed across the lake; they were boarding the hogwarts express; talking and laughing as the countryside became greener and tidier; eating bettie bott's every flavor beans as they sped past muggle towns; pulling off their wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats; pulling into platform nine and three-quarters at king's cross station. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "it took quite a while for them all to get off the platform. a wizened old guard was up by the ticket barrier, letting them go through the gate in twos and threes so they didn't attract attention by all bursting out of a solid wall at once and alarming the muggles. \r\n",
